# Final-Project-Back-End-ZTM

The aim of the project was to create all parts of the project in order to build a real experience of how to integrate and build all parts of the project.

The Front-End was created and developed in React, using TypeScript in the NextJs framework.

It was used from the axios dependency, for consumption of the created API.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
