# Final-Project-Back-End-ZTM

The aim of the project was to create all parts of the project in order to build a real experience of how to integrate and build all parts of the project.

The Front-End was created and developed in React, using TypeScript in the NextJs framework.

It was used from the axios dependency, for consumption of the created API.

The Tailwind CSS framework was used for learning and also to provide productivity, since all styling was used in line.

TSParticles was also used for learning, and as background styling.

## Getting Started

First, before running the development server, we need to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```
Now we need to run the development server:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
